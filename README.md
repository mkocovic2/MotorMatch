## Introduction
MotorMatch is a Swift-based iOS app. It uses specific APIs to retrieve information on the vehicle the user is trying to find. The vehicle data is gathered using an API created by API Ninjas. For other features, an API created by OpenAI is used to achieve certain features within the app.

## Features
- **Vehicle Searching:** The user is able to search for certain vehicles, displaying an array of data that could be useful to the user.
- **Mechanic Page:** Using a GPT API, the user can ask questions that the AI is prompted to answer.
- **User Manual:** Displays tips and useful information about general knowledge.
- **Useful Resources:** MotorMatch displays a small library of reliable sources that extends outside the app.
- **Vehicle Comparison:** MotorMatch is able to compare statistics on two vehicles, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of both vehicles.

## Getting Started
1. Open MotorMatch on VSCode.
2. Within the "mechanicPage.Swift" file, include an API authentication key for OpenAI. Without this key, the app will still work, but the mechanic page will not respond to any user inputs.
3. Run the program in VSCode.

## Using the App
When using MotorMatch, the user will get prompted with a small introduction. Once the introduction has concluded, the user is free to explore the app as they please.

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** MotorMatch provides a user-friendly environment, valuing simplicity and intuitive navigation.
2. **Quick Data Retrieval:** MotorMatch supplies the user with quick-to-access information. There are little to no wait times when receiving vehicle data.
3. **Statistics Definition:** A small library is provided to explain car statistics; these definitions explain the importance of cylinders, MPG, etc.

## GPT Integration
MotorMatch uses the GPT API to provide certain features that most APIs aren't able to supply. This integration has helped with answering questions not listed on the app and providing information that is locked behind expensive APIs.
